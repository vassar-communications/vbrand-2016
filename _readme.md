About Apply Vassar Design
=========================

This does two things:

* applies CSS that overrides the theme's current CSS.
* adds a class to the body tag containing the current theme name. This is so styles can be scoped to theme-specific elements.


Notes
-----

This is *not* designed to work with every theme, nor is it meant to be a full-featured theme on its own; in that case, it would be a theme, not a plugin. I built it for Twenty Sixteen. This is intended for scenarios where we need to apply Vassar branding to sites with the default WP theming.
